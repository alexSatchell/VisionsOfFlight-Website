# VOF Website
this is the website for visions on flight.

Javascript Code
- The index.html page includes the JS code for the slide to automatically move,
the actual code resides in the srciptSlideNavigation.js

- The index.html page includes JS code directly under the form. The JS code causes the modal
form window to go away if the user clicks off of the form.

- The shop.html page includes JS code that will display a countdown until the official merchandise is released.

Multimedia
- The form-confirmation.html page displays a html video element (mp4) with controls.

Special Features
- This project taught me a lot and gave me a good introduction into responsive design. My goal was
to design this with mobile in mind. The only page that is not completely responsive at this moment is the 
individual artist bios page. However you can test the other pages and see the content will shrink to fit different 
screen sizes in the dev tools.

Issues
- representatives from the group were almost impossible to motivate and reach at times. Getting the folder
containing the images proved to be way more challenging then it should have been. It was also confusing
how the artist wanted to provide bios, and within 3 weeks of the meeting, I still have not been provided them.
For the time being, I have them filled in with lorem ipsum.

- I battled trying to get 3 elements at the bottom of the footer (the 3rd element being the subscribe button).
I ended up just placing the sub button on the index page.

Load Time
- after some modifications to the images, my pages load at around 1.1s to 1.5s, however 1 out of 5 times
it randomly hits a 5s load time.

Thoughts
- This project taught me a lot and I can already recognize things I would like to go about differently
and learn from in the future. I appreciate the guidance you gave to me along the semester on my labs,
and look forward to web programming 2. Thank you.
